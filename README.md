## Workflow



## Limitations
This project serves as a proof of concept, showcasing the effectiveness of Edge Detection, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques in identifying Pokemon cards from images. However, there are several limitations to acknowledge:
- **Picture limitation:** The picture taken by the used needs to have a white background as that is how the edge detection model was trained.
- **Limited Set Data:** While there exist around 100 sets of Pokemon cards, our model is trained on a subset of 20 sets. 
- **Limited Language Support:** The current model is trained solely on English cards.
