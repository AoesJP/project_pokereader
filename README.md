## Limitations:
This project serves as a proof of concept, showcasing the effectiveness of Edge Detection, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques in identifying Pokemon cards from images. However, there are several limitations to acknowledge:
Limited Set Data: While there exist around 100 sets of Pokemon cards, our model is trained on a subset of 20 sets. This means that it may not accurately recognize cards from sets outside of this subset.
Limited Language Support: The current model is trained solely on English cards. Consequently, it may struggle to identify cards with Japanese text or from other languages.
